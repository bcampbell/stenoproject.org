Steno is a native GUI application for analysing articles.
Fulltext search queries are supported, and articles may be tagged.
Collected articles can be 'slurped' down from a server.

### Steno-Similar

This is a tool for bulk-comparing sets of articles.
Given two sets of articles, it generates an HTML report showing articles which look similar.

It comes in two flavours: a commandline version and one which has a little GUI to help set the various options.

No real documentation yet, but the commandline version has a [README](https://github.com/bcampbell/steno/blob/master/cmd/steno-similar/README.txt) with a few clues.

The source code for both cli and gui flavours can be found in the steno repository [on github](https://github.com/bcampbell/steno/tree/master/cmd).
