## Downloads

Latest windows build: [`steno_windows_64bit_2017-05-22.zip`](/dl/steno_windows_64bit_2017-05-22.zip)

(note, this is an old release. If you want a more recent version, or want a Linux or Mac version then you'll need to compile it from source, which is currently a little fiddly. But ask on the mailing list and we'll help you figure it out!).

## Source Code

Any other tools, you'll need to compile from source for now.
